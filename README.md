# Bouncing Ball Simulation

## Description

A simple 2d and graph simulation of a ball dropped from a height 'h'.

## Prelequisites

Tkinter  
Python  
Matplotlib: After setting up python and tkinter in the computer install Matplotlib using the following command  
pip install matplotlib  

## Running the simulation

To run the simulation use command:  
Python bouncing_ball.py if on python 2.x.x.  
python3 bouncing_ball.py if on python 3.x.x.  

Then input "2D" to run the simulation or "graph" to display a graph of height against time.
